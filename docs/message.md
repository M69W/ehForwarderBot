# Message Object (`EFBMsg`)
Message objects is one of the key concept in EFB. It's an universal standard to carry message, media, file and all other information between master and slave channels. It's critical for plugin makers to understand the message concept, and follow it as far as possible so as to ensure a smooth workflow between channels.

## Initialization
You can initialize a message object with your channel as the argument. This allows the object to automatically obtain name, ID and icon from the channel.

```python
msg = EFBMsg(self)
```

## Basic properties
* `channel_name`, `channel_emoji`, `channel_id` should be set during the initialization process.
* `source`: the type of sender of the message, a `MsgSource` object.  
  Possible values: `MsgSource.User`, `MsgSource.Group`, `MsgSource.System`
* `type`: Type of message, a `MsgType` object, default to `MsgType.Text`. Will introduce it in later part.
* `member`: The member in a group who sent the message. A "User dict" or `None`. Only available when `msg.source == MsgSource.Group`.
* `origin`: The sender, a user or a group who sent the message. A "User dict".
* `destination`: The destination user/group of the message. A "User dict", `"channel"` property is required, and shall not equal to the `channel_id` of the message.
* `target`: A "Target dict" or none. Used when the message is reply to or referring to another message or user.
* `uid`: String. A unique ID of the message. If your platform did not offer one, you may use the concatenation of the channel ID and a random GUID.
* `text`: String. The text content of the message.

### "User dict"
A user dict is used to represent a specific user or chat from a specific channel. It should looks like:
```python
{
    "channel": "<channel_id>",
    # The unique channel ID where the user is from.
    # Optional if it's the same channel as the message sender.
    "name": "Eana Hufwe",
    # Name of the User/Chat, as set by itself.
    "alias": "Bossy",
    # Alias/nickname/alternative name set by the user. Keep same as "name" if not available.
    "UID": "13245768"
    # Unique ID of the user/chat in the channel.
    # Must be unique and consistent within the channel.
}
```

### "Target dict"
Target dict is used when a message is reply to another message, or referring to other user(s).

There are 3 types of targets: `Member`, `Message`, and `Substitution`

**TargetType: Member**  
This is for the case where the message is targeting to a specific member in the group. `target['target']` here is a "User dict".

!!! note "Example"
    Sample target.

        target = {
           'type': TargetType.Member,
           'target': {
               "name": "Target name",
               'alias': 'Target alias',
               'uid': 'Target UID',
           }
        }

**TargetType: Message**  
This is for the case where the message is directly replying to another message. `target['target']` here is an `EFBMsg` object.

!!! tip
    Depends on the need of the other channel, you may need to include at least:

    * User dict for sender and recipient
    * Message type and text
    * Message unique ID

    But try to include as much detail as possible.

!!! note "Notice"
    You should not include further Target dict in this `EFBMsg` object.


!!! note "Example"
    Sample target.

        target = {
           'type': TargetType.Message,
           'target': EFBMsg()
        }


**TargetType: Substitution**  
This is for the case when user "@-ed" a list of users in the message. `target['target']` here is a dict of correspondence between the string, or start and end point of the substring (in Python index) used to refer to the user in the message and a user dict.

!!! note "Example"
    Sample target.

        target = {
           'type': TargetType.Substitution,
           'target': {
              '@alice': {
                  'name': "Megpoid",
                  'alias': 'Gumi',
                  'uid': "123456"
              },
              '@bob': {
                  'name': "Gackpoid",
                  'alias': 'Gakupo',
                  'uid': "654321"
              },
              (13, 18): {
                  'name': "Cyber Songman",
                  'alias': "Cyman",
                  'uid': "162534"
              }
              # Here (13, 18) refers to msg.text[13:18]
           }
        }


## Media storage
Any media should be saved into the local storage path. The standard path should be `./storage/<channel id>/<filename>`. File should at least have read permission for all users. File may be unlink (deleted) by the target channel.

## Message types
### Text message
**Type**: MsgType.Text
