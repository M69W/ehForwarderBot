# Slave Channels
A _Slave channel_ is a channel that delivers messages between a chat platform
and the master channel.

## Structure
A slave channel class should inherit from the `EFBChannel` class, with some properties set as follows:
```python
class MySlaveChannel(EFBChannel):
    channel_name = "My Slave Channel"
    # Name of channel
    channel_emoji = "‚≠ê"
    # Icon for the channel, better to choose an emoji similar to the original
    # logo of your platform.
    channel_id = "eh_random_slave"
    # Unique ID for the channel. Recommended format:
    # <author unique name>_<platform name>_slave
    channel_type = ChannelType.Slave
```

### Message queue
In the beginning, each channel is initialized with the common queue, namely a Python `queue.Queue()` queue. This is where your slave channel delivers messages to the master channel. Whenever there is a new message IS COMING from the slave channel, it should be processed to a `EFBMsg` object and then put in to the queue with `self.queue.put(mobj)` method.

A few methods are required to be implemented for every slave channel.

### `__init__(self, queue, mutex)`
`super().__init__(queue, mutex)` should be called in the beginning. The "super" `__init__` method assigns the message `queue` and `mutex` to their respective places. Any other authorization steps are recommended to be done in this method.

!!! note
    Try to avoid user interaction as far as possible, if there is a way to login the platform using any fixed credentials, please avoid using dynamical verification.

When you have to interact with the user for critical issues including reauthentication, you should lock `self.mutex` while doing so to avoid conflicting interactions.

If your platform requires the user to provide any tokens (API key, secret, username, password, etc), you may ask your user to save those information to `config.py`, in a `dict` variable named with your channel unique ID. You can import it with `import config`, and call it with `config.<channel_id>`.

Definition of config keys and values should be written in the class docstring, and your channel support page.

### `poll(self)`
This method should start polling for new message and prepare for pushing it to the queue.

### `send_message(self, msg)`
This method sends a message from the master channel to your channel. `msg` is an `EFBMsg` object, delivered out from the master channel.

Some exceptions you may need to raise while processing an incoming message:

* `EFBChatNotFound`:  
  When the target chat/user is not found, or not reachable from the current user.
* `EFBMessageNotFound`:  
  When the message is replying to another message that is not found, or not reply-able.
* `EFBMessageTypeNotSupported`:  
  When the incoming message is in a type not supported by your platform.

You can also use any other existing exceptions or write your own exceptions.

### `get_chats(self)`
This method returns a `list` of `dict`s, where each item represents a chat session. It can be:

* A "user", a "group", or a "bot" in Telegram, Messenger, WhatsApp, Line, WeChat, etc.
* A "channel" in IRC, Slack
* Any possible "Direct Message" conversations in Twitter, Slack, etc.
* A "channel" in Telegram _(cuz it's different from that "channel")_

To simplify the categorization process, we name that:
* __"User"__ type is for those we send and get messages to one person.  
(Telegram _Channels_ with Admin access falls under here).
* __"Group"__ type is for those we send and get message to more than one person.

!!! note
    You may not include chats that you can't send a message to, e.g. Telegram Channels with no admin access.

Each `dict` item should have:
```python
{
    'channel_name': self.channel_name,
    # Channel name
    'channel_id': self.channel_id,
    # Channel's unique ID
    'name': "Eana Hufwe",
    # Display name of the chat
    'alias': "Bossy",
    # Alternative name set by the user,
    # keep as same as "name" if not available
    'uid': "13245768",
    # Unique ID of the chat, keep it as unique and consistent as possible
    'type': "User"
    # "User" or "Group"
}
```

## Identifiers
As far as possible, the channel should associate each user, group and group member a unique and canonical ID, used to identify a chat or a user in a message, sending message from master channel, and other possible occasions.

Note that the ID should be and only need to be unique in your channel. There is no need to consider the uniqueness across all channels.

## Command message
Slave channels can send messages that offer the user options to take actions. This can be used in situations such as friend request, fund transfer and Telegram Inline Buttons.

Aside from sending a message with "Command" type (refer to the specification in "Message" documentation), the slave channel has to also provide a method for the command to be issued.

The method can take any argument (positional and keyword) of Python's standard data structure, and returns a string which is shown to the user as the result of the action.

## Extra functions
In some cases, your slave channel may allow the user to achieve extra functionality, such as creating groups, managing group members, etc.

You can receive such commands issued in a CLI-like style. An "extra function" method should only take one string parameter aside from `self`, and wrap it with `@extra` decorator from `utils` module. The extra decorator takes 2 arguments: `name`, a short name of the function, and `desc` a description of the function and its usage.

!!! note "More on `desc`"
    `desc` should describe what the function does and how to use it. It's more like the help text for an CLI program. Since method of calling an extra function depends on the implementation of the master channel, you should use `{function_name}` as the function name in `desc`, and master channel will replace it with respective name.

The method should in the end return a string, which will be shown to the user as the result. Depending on the functionality of the function, it may be just a simple success message, or a long chunk of results.

Callable name of extra functions has a more strict standard than a normal Python 3 identifier name, for compatibility reason. An extra function callable name should:

* be case sensitive
* include only upper and lower-case letters, digits, and underscore.
* starts only with a upper or lower-case letter.
* be in a length between 1 and 20 inclusive
* _be as short and concise as possible, but keep understandable_

In RegEx, it's can be expressed as:
```regex
^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]{0,19}$
```


Example:
```python
@extra(name="New group",
       desc="Create a new group.\n" +
            "Usage:\n" +
            "    {function_name} group_name|member_id_1|member_id_2|...\n" +
            "    e.g.: {function_name} My Group|123456|654321|393901"
            "    group_name: Name of new group, \"|\" is not allowed.\n" +
            "    member_id_n: ID of group members, you should fill at least one.")
def new_group(self, param):
    param = param.split('|')
    if len(param) < 2:
        return "Group name and at least one member ID should be provided."
    group_name = param[0]
    members = param[1:]
    try:
        self.myChat.create_group(group_name, members)
    except Exception as e:
        return repr(e)
    return "Group %s created with members %s." % (group_name, members).
```
